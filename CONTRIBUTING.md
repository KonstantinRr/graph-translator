# Contributing

I welcome any contribution to the project, however I have to note that this project was build during the Bachelor Thesis at the University of Groningen. I therefore don't plan on adding any new features or responding to pull requests in the future. Every future work is completeley voluntarily.

If you encounter any bugs (or you want to create new features) feel free to make a pull request or contact me at konstantin.rolf@gmail.com. There are no special guidelines except that the changes should be well documented. An issue template is available in the repository.

Happy Coding!
